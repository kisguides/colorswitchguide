<p>Color switch is a game where you have to bounce a ball upwards through different spinning shapes. The shapes are made of different colours and your ball may only past through the same colour. You bounce the ball by tapping the screen at various speeds. As you travel through multi-coloured circles your ball will change colour. </p>

<p>There is no time limit in the game but it is measured by how many stars you pick up equating to your score. Each shape you pass roughly equals one score. </p>

<p>Weâ€™ve assessed the game to be a high difficulty level. This is because the timing of each press to surpass certain shapes requires good co-ordination and a high level of focus. Although, shapes are generated randomly so it is partly due to the luck of the draw.</p>

<h3>
<a id="tactics" class="anchor" href="#tactics" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tactics</h3>

<p>Overall the main strategy is to keep a consistent tap rate on the screen by roughly keeping your finger at the level of the ball. Now when you reach a shape you must tap faster to pass through your colour safely, use our shape guide below to learn the techniques needed to pass through the shapes. </p>

<p>The types of shape you will encounter include circles, triangles, lines and crosses as well as two shapes at the same time. The shapes spin at different speeds and directions so pay attention even if you come across the same shape twice.</p>

<p>See the shapes tab for a guide on how to pass each shape.</p>

<a id="tips" class="anchor" href="#tips" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips</h3>

<ol>
<li>Without a doubt, this is one of the most fustrating games because you'll die alot. So the number one tip is to stay calm, relax and focus on your rythmn of tapping - make sure you understand how far you ball travels with each tap.</li>
<li>When approaching shapes give yourself about 1cm (on a 4.7inch screen) for the most effective tapping time.</li>
<li>When you want to keep the ball level you'll find it easier to keep your finger inline with the ball and tap.</li>
<li>Be mindful of the speed of the shapes, as the same shape may have different speeds. The faster it moves, the quickier you'll have to tap to pass through.</li>
<li>Once you've passed through a colour changer, take time to pay attention to your new colour. This may seem simple, but the number of lives lost because you've not realised it's changed is higher than you think.<br>
</li>
<li>When facing double circles, the colour of your ball is always synchronised to allow you to pass. Other colours, may not line up.</li>
<li>At the start if you loose your rythmn, you can just stop tapping and let the ball lay on the floor, then start tapping when you're ready. </li>
<li>If you earn enough stars, you can change the shape of your ball. So keep practicing! </li>
<li>As you know different shapes turn in different directions, which may not be important in a circle but it will affect your strategy in other non-symmetrical shapes.</li>
<li>You can see the leaderboard by clicking the red bar graph icon on the home screen.</li>
<li>Don't double press the iphone button to minimise the screen at any time because when re-entering the game you'll die.</li>
<li>If you plan on going full concentration mode and getting a top score, it's best to put your phone in aeroplane mode and turn off any alarms as if you get a notification while playing you'll most definitely die.</li>
<li>Act Fast: If you play the game a lot, you're find that the colour the ball changes to is most likely the colour coming up for the next shape, so act fast!</li>
